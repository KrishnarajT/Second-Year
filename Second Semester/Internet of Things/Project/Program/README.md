# Ambulance-Detector
IOT Project by our group, for detecting an ambulance passing through a signal with a Raspberry Pi with a Camera Module. 

# Problem Statement

Most Streets in India often undergo frequent traffic disputes, leading to the more than 450,000 Road
accidents, and 150,000 Deaths Per year, and this number does not show any declining trends. A
leading factor in these accidents, is frustration resulting from long waits in Traffid signals.

Our Aim then, is to Smartly control traffic signals, and try to reduce severe wait times
at intersections.
