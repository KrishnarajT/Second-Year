    "*Python* is a general-purpose programming language that is becoming increasingly popular in scientific computing. It is a high-level language, meaning that it is easy to read and write, and it is interpreted, meaning that it does not need to be compiled before it is run. Python is also an object-oriented language, meaning that it allows the user to define new types of objects and to create instances of those objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a dynamically typed language, meaning that the type of a variable is determined at run time, rather than at compile time. Python is a multi-paradigm language, meaning that it supports multiple programming styles, including object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming. Python is a multi-platform language, meaning that it can be run on a variety of operating systems, including Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux."
